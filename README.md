Project: Aloha

Designed from a mock-up web page in three different sizes: (mobile version, tablet version and desktop version). All the images, designs and color pallets were provide by RED Academy Toronto. My goal was to create an interactive version that is visually the same as the mock-up version.

Personal Learnings:

This is my first project. The project it self covers variaties of tasks as:            
    . Proper using of the .html, .css and .js sytax;
    . Linking a default .css reset layout so prevents styling iregularities down the road;
    . Linking the .html file with .css and .js files;
    . Sourcing and implementing the font that was used for the project from an external source (Font Awesome);
    . Implementing a java script plug-in from a different source (Flickity);
    . Using a terminal for all the operations such as: creating folders, files, uploads on github etc.;

This is only a mock-up version of a web page and if you wish to explore it further, please download all the files to your computer and run the index.html file in your preffered browser. For best interaction with the page, I recomend Google Chrome.
